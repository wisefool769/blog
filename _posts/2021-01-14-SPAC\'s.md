# SPAC's

SPAC's aka "Special Purpose Acquisition Companies" aka "Blank Check" companies are exploding in popularity. Depending on who you ask, they range from dangerous scam to single-handedly ending the Great Stagnation. I'm mostly interested in how retail investors like me can identify good ones and trade them without blowing up. Nothing in this post is investment advice. This is the financial analysis equivalent of some scrawls on a dirty napkin. It is only being made public as a ritual to summon true alpha from the dark recesses of the internet via Cunningham's Law.

## What are They
These are shell corporations that are designed to take companies public while avoiding the complexity, pomp, and cost of the usual IPO pony show. Instead, the process is: 

1. Pool funds from investors in SPAC
2. Decide on a target company
3. Perform a merger acquisition with target company within a set timeframe
4. ???
5. Profit!

When you invest in a SPAC nowadays, you are typically buying $10 units which consist of a common share and an out of the money warrant.  They can be traded as a package or with the share and warrant separately. Typically 85% to 100% of the 

## What Are They Worth? 
The value of the SPAC is floored at $10, since if the deal falls through, you can always get out here. Beyond that, you are just worried about the option premium.
We can use the dirty approximation for an at-the-money call option's value, as 0.4 * (Underlying Price)  * Volatility * sqrt(Time to Expiry). If you assume the price is 10, vol is 50%, and time to expiry is 6 months, you get to $1.40 -- giving a lower bound for SPAC value of $11.40. Of course, this is fairly conservative. Realized SPAC vol is somewhat higher than 50%, and perhaps you think the choice of target company has additional alpha. On the other hand, if you think that SPAC's are really just momentum plays on bad companies, this isn't really written for you.
